# H8WM

Perform several actions with one script:

pip install pywin32 keyboard pyautogui

How? 

- Listener uses keyboard package
- Simulation presses using PyAutoGUI
- Add some subprocess with PowerShell


I used https://github.com/7afidi/HideFromMyBoss as inspiration and simply added the task view directly after hiding on main screen.
